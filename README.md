# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to handle invalid input in route parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.  The lack of error handling can lead to unexpected crashes or, more critically, vulnerabilities.
